## About the Game
Hi-Lo is a guessing game where you predict if the next number will be higher or lower than the current number. Itâ€™s a simple and fun project that helped me learn the basics of Unity, 2D game design, and scripting.

---

## Features
- Random number generation for unpredictability.
- Clean and simple 2D design.
- Intuitive user interface for gameplay.
- Win/lose feedback based on player guesses.

## How to Play
1. A card is displayed on the screen.
2. Guess if the next card will be **higher** or **lower** by clicking the corresponding button.
3. If your guess is correct, you score a point and proceed to the next round.
4. If your guess is wrong, the game ends, and your score is displayed.
- **-- Ace is the highest value card, not the lowest --**

## Technologies Used
- **Unity:** For game development.
- **C#:** For scripting game logic.
- **WebGL:** To make the game playable in a browser.
